Todo list
./App
	1. make sure the app can be export to other machines <Flame>

./Randomforest/Client.py
	1. Client need to access dataset by using function members <KK>
		getX() to random set of samples,  e.g samples=[1,2,4,5,6], use numpy array is possible (Off is doing on this)
		getSize() to get the size of  samples. this similar to len(samples)
		getL( x )
		getI( theta, x )
		getParam( x )

class LibraryImageDataset
	1. Implement getX() <Off>
		to random set of n coordinates form each image and store in this format,  samples = { [ r, c, img ] }
	2. change the json write and load data structure <Flame>
		a data member in dataset class Limages (labeledImages) keeps all rectangles info,
		Limages[ image index ] [rect index]
	3. getI( theta, x )
